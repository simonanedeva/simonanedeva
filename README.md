# Hi, I'm Simona üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

I'm a Software Development student with over 5 years of professional experience in the IT industry. 

My journey into the world of programming began while I was recruiting developers at Commerzbank Digital Technology Center Sofia. The exposure to their work fascinated me, so I completed the **Programming Fundamentals with Java** at SoftUni. Shortly after, I seized the opportunity to challenge myself further by enrolling in the demanding **Telerik Alpha Java Track**, which I graduated in December 2023. At the same time, I began my **Masters Degree in Software Development** in October 2023.

With a good foundation in Java and a background in IT recruitment, I bring a unique perspective to software development. My agile mindset, coupled with a commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement, enables me to adapt to various team dynamics and be a valuable contributor within projects.
